<!-- FOLD INTO ASSIGNMENT POLICIES -->

1. Read the submission instructions carefully!
If you are missing some files, but we can still grade, you will lose 20% of the total points.
If we cannot grade your work due to missing files, you will receive no credit.
1. Save your project onto the `U:` drive, which is your EWS storage, and available across all of the computers in the lab.
If you save to the `C:` drive, your project will only exist on that single computer. 
1. If you use your own machine, make sure you use the version of Unity installed on all of the lab machines to avoid 
compatibility issues.
1. To enable autofill in Visual Studio 2019, go to `Edit` -> `Preferences` -> `External Tools` and change the <br>`External Tools Script Editor` from `Open File Extension` to `Visual Studio 2019`.
